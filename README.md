## Good vibes everybody ‚úåüèªÔ∏è

I'm a novice in QA Testing, but ready to collaborate and hunt those annoying bugs üêû.</br> My background in industrial maintenance and CNC programming has equipped me with strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a drive to optimize processes. I developed the ability to detect failures and implement effective solutions, which I now apply in the QA field. This multidisciplinary experience in mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems gives me a unique perspective as a QA Tester, allowing me to design thorough test scenarios and contribute to delivering reliable, high-quality software.</br> My main language is Spanish, but I'm pretty competent in English, so feel free to communicate with me in either of these languages.
